# Spring WebFlux Demo project

This project was built to show in a simple way, the difference between a synchronous and blocking call to the api, and an asynchronous one.

To run the project you need to have Java 11 and JAVA_HOME set on your environment variables, then you can use either:

On Linux

    ./mvnw spring-boot:run

On Windows

    .\mvnw spring-boot:run
